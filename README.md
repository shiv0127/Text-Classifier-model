# Text-Classifier-model
 A Text Classifier API using FastAPI and scikit-learn to categorize text inputs. It preprocesses text (e.g., TF-IDF), trains a model (e.g., SVM), and provides a /predict/ endpoint for predictions, returning categories and confidence scores. Ideal for tasks like sentiment analysis or spam detection.
